      Endowment 
    </h1>

    The Scotch’n’Soda Endowment Fund is a fund that was set up by an anonymous donor a few years ago. Every quarter interest from the fund, based on the interest/income rate set by the University, is deposited into our account. This fund is used exclusively for large, show-specific purchases.
